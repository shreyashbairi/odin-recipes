		</li>
		<li>
			<p>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
				<br> (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover,
				<br> raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have,
				<br> you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly
				<br> warm oven while preparing the rest.
